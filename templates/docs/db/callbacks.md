# Callbacks

Pop provides a means to execute code before and after database operations.
This is done by defining specific methods for your models. For
example, to hash a user password you may want to define the following method:

```go
type User struct {
	ID       uuid.UUID
	Email    string
	Password string
}

func (u *User) BeforeSave(tx *pop.Connection) error {
	hash, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(u.Password), bcrypt.DefaultCost)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.WithStack(err)
	}

	u.Password = string(hash)
	
	return nil
}
```

In the above example, when the connection's `Save` method is called with a `User`, the `BeforeSave` method 
will be called before writing to the database. The available callbacks include:
* BeforeSave
* BeforeCreate
* BeforeUpdate
* BeforeDestroy
* AfterSave
* AfterCreate
* AfterUpdate
* AfterDestroy
* AfterFind
