# Building

As explained in the [Generating a New Project](/docs/new-project) section, you can use the `build` command to build a full binary of your application:

```bash
$ buffalo build
```

```bash
--> cleaning up target dir
--> running node_modules/.bin/webpack
--> packing .../coke/actions/actions-packr.go
--> running go build -v -o bin/coke -ldflags -X main.version=b5dffda -X main.buildTime="2017-03-20T11:05:23-04:00"
--> cleaning up build
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up a
----> cleaning up a/a.go
----> cleaning up a/database.go
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up ...coke/actions/actions-packr.go
```

Binaries contain, by default, all of the assets, templates, and migrations used by your application. Binaries will also have the time and the git commit SHA burnt in, thus making the binaries "versioned".

<%= title("Define a Custom Binary Name", {name: "custom-bin-name"}) %>

By default, your application will be built in the `bin` directory of your project, and the name of the executable will be the name you used to create the project with the `new` command.

You can change this default name by using the `-o` or `-output` flag:

```bash
$ buffalo build -o bin/cookies
```

```bash
--> cleaning up target dir
--> running node_modules/.bin/webpack
--> packing .../coke/actions/actions-packr.go
--> running go build -v -o bin/cookies -ldflags -X main.version="2017-04-02T08:32:28+02:00" -X main.buildTime="2017-04-02T08:32:28+02:00"
--> cleaning up build
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up a
----> cleaning up a/a.go
----> cleaning up a/database.go
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up ...coke/actions/actions-packr.go
```

In fact, you can change the target directory too:

```bash
$ # Put the app in my home directory, as "coke"
$ buffalo build -o ~/coke
```

```bash
--> cleaning up target dir
--> running node_modules/.bin/webpack
--> packing .../coke/actions/actions-packr.go
--> running go build -v -o ~/coke -ldflags -X main.version="2017-04-02T08:32:28+02:00" -X main.buildTime="2017-04-02T08:32:28+02:00"
--> cleaning up build
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up a
----> cleaning up a/a.go
----> cleaning up a/database.go
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up ...coke/actions/actions-packr.go
```

<%= title("Extract Assets in a Zip File", {name: "extract-assets"}) %>

By default, your whole app is packed into a single executable, assets included. In production setups, you may want to serve these assets with a proxy server (like Apache or NGINX), to lower the app load. You may even use a *CDN* to handle your assets.

Buffalo provides a way to extract compiled app assets into a single archive, using the `-e` or `-extract-assets` flag:

```bash
$ buffalo build -e
```

```bash
--> cleaning up target dir
--> running node_modules/.bin/webpack
--> build assets archive
--> disable self assets handling
--> running go build -v -o bin/coke -ldflags -X main.version="2017-04-02T08:45:58+02:00" -X main.buildTime="2017-04-02T08:45:58+02:00"
--> cleaning up build
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up a
----> cleaning up a/a.go
----> cleaning up a/database.go
----> cleaning up buffalo_build_main.go
----> cleaning up ...coke/actions/actions-packr.go
```

Please note this will disable the internal assets handling too, so the final executable is lighter.

By default, the assets archive is put in the *bin* directory, but if you change the executable output directory with the `-o` flag, the assets will be put in the same directory.

```bash
$ ls -la bin
```

```bash
total 36280
drwxr-xr--@  4 markbates  staff   136B Apr  3 10:10 ./
drwxr-xr-x@ 20 markbates  staff   680B Apr  3 10:10 ../
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 markbates  staff    17M Apr  3 10:10 coke*
-rw-r--r--@  1 markbates  staff   691K Apr  3 10:10 coke-assets.zip
```

<%= title("Building \"Static\"/CGO Binaries") %>

Building statically linked binaries that contain CGO, think SQLite3, can be tricky. By using the `--static` flag with `buffalo build` the flags `--ldflags '-linkmode external -extldflags "-static"'` will be added to the `go build` command.

<%= title("Binary Commands") %>

Binaries, by default, run in `development` mode, which means all of the sub-commands will run in that mode as well. To change the mode, you must use the `GO_ENV` environment variable.

```bash
$ GO_ENV=production ./coke
```

Once a binary has been built there are several sub-commands that can be run on that binary.

### Default

The default command, if you just run the binary, will start the application.

### migrate

The `migrate` sub-command will run the migrations for the application.

### version

The `version` sub-command will output the version information for the binary, including the name, the git commit SHA used to build the binary, and the time the binary was built.

```bash
$ ./coke version
coke version 69b6a8b ("2017-04-03T10:19:46-04:00")
```

### task

The `task` sub-command runs tasks.

```bash
$ ./coke task greet

Hello World!
```

<%= title("Build Tags") %>

When building a Buffalo binary using the `buffalo build` command you can pass `--tags` and `--ldflags` to the built binary, just as you normally would when using the `go build` tools.

```bash
$ buffalo build --tags="mytag" --ldflags="-X foo.Bar=baz"
```
